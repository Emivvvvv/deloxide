 * "THE COFFEEWARE LICENSE" (Revision 1, Deloxide Edition):
 * Emirhan Tala and Ulaş Can Demirbağ wrote this file. As long as you retain
 * this notice, you can do whatever you want with this stuff — run it, fork it,
 * deploy it, tattoo it, or summon it in a thread ritual. We don't care.
 *
 * Just remember: we make no guarantees, provide no warranties, and accept no
 * responsibility for anything that happens. This software may or may not work,
 * may or may not cause your system to spontaneously combust into deadlocks,
 * and may or may not summon a sentient debugger from the void. But we accept
 * coffee! If we ever meet someday and you think this code helped you can buy 
 * us a coffee in return. Or not. No pressure. But coffee is nice. We love it!
