//! A tracked reader-writer lock for deadlock detection
//!
//! This RwLock provides the same interface as a standard reader-writer lock
//! but augments all lock/unlock operations with tracking for deadlock detection.
//! It is a drop-in replacement for std::sync::RwLock that enables advanced deadlock analysis.
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use deloxide::RwLock;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use std::thread;
//!
//! let lock = Arc::new(RwLock::new(10));
//! let lock_clone = Arc::clone(&lock);
//!
//! thread::spawn(move || {
//!     let data = lock_clone.read();
//!     println!("Read: {}", *data);
//! });
//!
//! let mut data = lock.write();
//! *data += 1;
//! ```
