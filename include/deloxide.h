/*
 * @file deloxide.h
 * @brief C API for the Rust deloxide deadlock detection library.
 *
 * Deloxide is a cross-language deadlock detector that helps identify potential
 * deadlocks in multi-threaded applications before they cause your program to hang.
 * It works by tracking mutex operations and relationships between threads and locks,
 * providing real-time detection of deadlock cycles.
 *
 * This header provides the C API for integrating Deloxide into C applications.
 *
 * Quick start:
 * 1. Call deloxide_init() to initialize the library
 * 2. Use deloxide_create_mutex() to create tracked mutexes
 * 3. Use the LOCK_MUTEX() and UNLOCK_MUTEX() macros to operate on mutexes
 * 4. Create threads with CREATE_TRACKED_THREAD() macro for proper tracking
 * 5. If a deadlock is detected, your callback function will be invoked
 *
 * Example:
 * ```c
 * void deadlock_callback(const char* json_info) {
 *     printf("Deadlock detected! Info: %s\n", json_info);
 * }
 *
 * void* worker(void* arg) {
 *     void* mutex = (void*)arg;
 *     LOCK_MUTEX(mutex);
 *     // Critical section
 *     UNLOCK_MUTEX(mutex);
 *     return NULL;
 * }
 *
 * DEFINE_TRACKED_THREAD(worker)
 *
 * int main() {
 *     deloxide_init(NULL, deadlock_callback);
 *     void* mutex = deloxide_create_mutex();
 *
 *     pthread_t thread;
 *     CREATE_TRACKED_THREAD(thread, worker, mutex);
 *
 *     pthread_join(thread, NULL);
 *     deloxide_destroy_mutex(mutex);
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * ```

/*
 * --- High-Level Macros for Easier Tracked Usage ---
 *
 * These macros simplify correct usage of Deloxide from C.
 *
 * 1. Tracked Threads:
 *    - Automatically register spawn and exit events for threads.
 *    - Example usage:
 *
 *        void* worker(void* unused) {
 *            LOCK_MUTEX(mutex);
 *            // do work
 *            UNLOCK_MUTEX(mutex);
 *            return NULL;
 *        }
 *
 *        DEFINE_TRACKED_THREAD(worker)
 *
 *        pthread_t t;
 *        CREATE_TRACKED_THREAD(t, worker);
 *
 * 2. Tracked Mutexes:
 *    - Simplify locking and unlocking tracked mutexes.
 *    - Always uses correct thread ID internally.
 *    - Example:
 *
 *        LOCK_MUTEX(mutex);
 *        ... critical section ...
 *        UNLOCK_MUTEX(mutex);
